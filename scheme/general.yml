            File storage search path.

            Depending on the computing environment, files may be stored in locations with
            a different root (for example when moving from a Microscoft Windows to a
            Linux workstation). This allows files to be represented as, for example

                {storage}/rawdata/datafile-01.data

            so that a configuration file must not be edited.
